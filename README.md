## HASTE: multi-Hypothesis Asynchronous Speeded-up Tracking of Events
This repository will include the reference implementation of the trackers described in "**HASTE: multi-Hypothesis Asynchronous Speeded-up Tracking of Events**", Alzugaray & Chli, BMVC 2020 (To appear), and "**Asynchronous Multi-Hypothesis Tracking of Features with Event Cameras**", Alzugaray and Chli, 3DV 2019.  These works were developed at the [Vision for Robotics Lab](http://v4rl.ethz.ch/), [ETH Zurich](http://ethz.ch/). 

The code will be uploaded in the following months. Should you have any inquires, please do not hesistate to contact me at ialzugaray@mavt.ethz.ch.
